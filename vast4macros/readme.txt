Instructions to manage (add/edit) the macros displayed in vast-4-macros-latest.html
(This should only be done by the IAB Tech Lab Video WOrking Group lead/product manager)

1. Update the google spreadsheet here with the desired changes https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGyz1HB92SLqOf7Ch2MF1LhP_IdpWT1aMBK_PR5gdiA/edit?usp=sharing 
2. Run "Export JSON" command to export the json version of the macros.
3. Copy the json exported to data/macros-data.json file.

Note - if the "Export JSON" command does not show up on the menu options on the google doc, please add the script by going to the script editor.


Also, a big thank you to Andrei Andreev @ Sizmek for putting these pages together!
